DDL files for the Bessie database.
Visual Paradigm - Community Edition does not support DDL generation. I have to do in manually. No big deal.
I will maintain them manually. I would probably have done this anyway.

I will start with one file per table, probably including associated indexes and constraints,
eventually I will create a single consolidated DDL file for distribution with the product.

The text files will make a good simple test of GitHub.
